# TerraLab

**Real-time planetary simulation infrastructure**

TerraLab is a geospatial engine that renders Earth at any scale with centimeter precision. We combine real-world data (NASA elevation, OpenStreetMap) with procedural generation to create interactive, Real environments.

The platform runs at 60+ FPS and supports real-time terrain modification. What you see is geospatially accurate and editable.

### Built for

Simulating scenarios across any location on Earth. Building applications that require both geospatial accuracy and creative freedom.

### Architecture

Node-based system where everything (terrain, objects, physics) is serializable and accessible through uniform APIs. The engine handles planetary-scale rendering through quadtree LOD systems while maintaining precision down to individual centimeters.

### Status

Production engine developed over years of R&D. Now opening to partners building spatial AI and simulation applications.
